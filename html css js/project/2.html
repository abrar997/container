      Walt Disney was born on<b> December 5, 1901</b>, at 1249 Tripp Avenue, in Chicago's Hermosa neighborhood.He was
      the <b>fourth </b>son of Elias Disney‍—‌born in the Province of Canada, to Irish parents‍—‌and Flora,an American
      of German and English descent.Aside from Walt, Elias and Flora's sons were Herbert, Raymond and Roy; the couple
      had a fifth child, Ruth,<b> in December 1903</b>.<b>In 1906</b>, when Disney was four, the family moved to a farm
      in Marceline, Missouri, where his uncle Robert had just purchased land.In Marceline, Disney developed his interest
      in drawing when he was paid to draw the horse of a retired neighborhood doctor. Elias was a subscriber to the
      Appeal to Reason newspaper, and Disney practiced drawing by copying the front-page cartoons of Ryan Walker. Disney
      also began to develop an ability to work with watercolors and crayons. He lived near the Atchison, Topeka and
      Santa Fe Railway line and became enamored with trains.He and his younger sister Ruth started school at the same
      time at the Park School in Marceline <b>in late 1909</b>.<br>

      near the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway line and became enamored with trains. He started school t the Park
      School in Marceline<b> in late 1909</b>.
      <b>In 1911 </b>, the Disneys moved to Kansas City, Missouri.There, Disney attended the Benton Grammar School,
      where he met fellow-student Walter Pfeiffer, who came from a family of theatre fans and introduced Disney to the
      world of vaudeville and motion pictures.
      Elias had purchased a newspaper delivery route for The Kansas City Star and Kansas City Times with his brother for
      more than six years.He attended Saturday courses at the Kansas City Art Institute and also took a correspondence
      course in cartooning.
      <br><b>In 1917 </b>, Elias bought stock in a Chicago jelly producer, the O-Zell Company, and moved back to the
      city with his family.
      <b>In mid-1918 </b>, Disney attempted to join the United States Army to fight against the Germans, but he was
      rejected for being too young. After forging the date of birth on his birth certificate, he joined the Red Cross in
      September 1918 as an ambulance driver. He was shipped to France but arrived in November, after the armistice. He
      drew cartoons on the side of his ambulance for decoration and had some of his work published in the army newspaper
      Stars and Stripes.Disney returned to Kansas City .<b>in October 1919</b>,where he worked as an apprentice artist
      at the Pesmen-Rubin Commercial Art Studio. There, he drew commercial illustrations for advertising, theater
      programs and catalogs. He also befriended fellow artist (Ub Iwerks).
      <!--<img src="q1.jpg">-->
      <br><b>In January 1920 </b>, as Pesmen-Rubin's revenue declined after Christmas, Disney and Iwerks were laid off.
      They started their own business,In January 1920,as Pesmen-Rubin's revenue declined after Christmas, Disney and
      Iwerks were laid off. They started their own business.The company produced commercials using the cutout animation
      technique. Disney became interested in animation, although he preferred drawn cartoons such as Mutt and Jeff and
      Koko the Clown.
      Disney opened a new business with a co-worker from the Film Ad Co, Fred Harman.Their main client was the local
      Newman Theater, and the short cartoons they produced were sold as "Newman's Laugh-O-Grams".
      Disney studied Paul Terry's Aesop's Fables as a model, and the first six "Laugh-O-Grams" were modernized fairy
      tales.
      <br><b>In May 1921 </b>, the success of the "Laugh-O-Grams" led to the establishment of Laugh-O-Gram Studio, for
      which he hired more animators, including Fred Harman's brother Hugh, Rudolf Ising and Iwerks.
      The Laugh-O-Grams cartoons did not provide enough income to keep the company solvent, so Disney started production
      of Alice's Wonderland‍—‌based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland‍—‌which combined live action with animation; he
      cast Virginia Davis in the title role. The result, a 12-and-a-half-minute, one-reel film, was completed too late
      to save Laugh-O-Gram Studio, which went into bankruptcy <b>in 1923</b>.
      Disney moved to Hollywood in <b>July 1923</b>.
      Disney and his brother Roy formed the Disney Brothers Studio‍—‌which later became The Walt Disney Company‍—‌to
      produce the films;they persuaded Davis and her family to relocate to Hollywood to continue production, with Davis
      on contract at $100 a month. <b>In July 1924 </b>, Disney also hired Iwerks, persuading him to relocate to
      Hollywood from Kansas City

      .<br>Early in 1925, Disney hired an ink artist, Lillian Bounds. They married in July of that year, at her
      brother's house in her hometown of Lewiston, Idaho. The marriage was generally happy, according to Lillian,
      although according to Disney's biographer Neal Gabler she did not "accept Walt's decisions meekly or his status
      unquestionably, and she admitted that he was always telling people 'how henpecked he is Lillian had little
      interest in films or the Hollywood social scene and she was,in the words of the historian Steven Watts, "content
      with household management and providing support for her husband". Their marriage produced two daughters, Diane<b>
        (born December 1933)</b> and Sharon <b>(adopted in December 1936, born six weeks previously)</b>.
